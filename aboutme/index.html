    <h2>Mireya Vera</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Mireya and I'm from Lima-Peru. I'm majoring in Data Science and still applying for different jobs and internships to graduate this year!</p>
    <p>I started school at Ensign College in 2020 while doing BYUI online (that's why I am graduating faster, I took a lot of credits.) I realized I enjoy working with data since I took a SQL course. Now, I like creating visualizations and reports better.</p>
    <p>Some of the things I love are singing, dancing, and watching Netflix. If you see me watching on campus, I'll probably be wearing my airpods and dancing while walking... (I shouldn't do it, but it is hard for me to listen to music without dancing.) </p>
    <p>I'm not married, but I'm dating someone that is very special and hopefully, things get more serious. Hope to get along with all of you!</p>
